# AI Custom Mockup
This is a chrome browser extension which sets Samsung Galaxy Note 5 as default mockup of MIT Appinventor Creator. This is an output of a small challenge, that i took to add a custom phone mockup in MIT Appinventor Creator. It's done, but definetly there are some bugs and errors in this which i'll keep fixing as per your reports.
